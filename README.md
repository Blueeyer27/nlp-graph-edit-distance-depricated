# nlp-graph-edit-distance

A thesis project focusing on the usage of dependency graphs as a representation of natural language text. 
Sentences are represented as graph structures, tagged with part-of-speech tags and relations between words.
This representation is used as a measure of similarity between two sentences.

--------------------------------

# Dependencies
 * java7
 * maven

# Quick start
From the command line in the project root directory:
	mvn compile
	mvn exec:java

Enter two sentences, and the graph edit distance will be printed
